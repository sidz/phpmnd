# How to contribute

Contributions are always welcome. Here are a few guidelines to be aware of:

- Include tests for new behaviours introduced by PRs.
- Fixed bugs MUST be covered by test(s) to avoid regression.
- All code must follow the project coding style standards which can be achieved by running `make cs-check`
- Before implementing a new big feature, consider creating a new issue on Github. It will save your
  time when the core team is not going to accept it or has good recommendations about how to
  proceed.


## Tests

To run the tests locally, you can run `make test`. For more granular tests, you can run `make` to see
the available commands.
